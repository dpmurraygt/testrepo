**Application of a consistent Framework to solving Problems 3

My expectation is that in this course I'll improve my ability to apply a consistent and repeatable framework to problems.  Right now I work in a very free form which is not repeatable or necessarily fully understandable by others.

In the full program, I would expect my machine learning, computer programming and Statistics skills to be most improved.
